<h1><font size="5">OUTDOOR/OUTBOUND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING></font></h1>

<section id ="program">
<h4><font color="#ff6600">Program Overview</font></h4>
<li>The general philosophy that is the basis of our outdoor experiential program is taking the participants to an environment away from their typical day-day life and let them experience situations that they may be familiar with, be able to reflect on that experience and create new possibilities through new behaviour. 
The activities are typically designed to improve leadership, communication skills, planning, change management, delegation, teamwork, and motivation. Strategies are formulated to deal with factors that hinder, and these strategies are then put to use in the activities that follow, to test their effectiveness.</li>
